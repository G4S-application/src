# Information System Analysis for G4S

## Overview

G4S is a multinational security company headquartered in London, with over 800,000 employees worldwide. With a network of operations across Europe and revenue of $20 billion, G4S offers cutting-edge security solutions, supporting local communities and clients through best practices.

In Greece, G4S has been a leader since 1978, providing security for major clients like Vodafone and the Athens International Airport, and employing up to 3,000 people during peak seasons. However, internal communication issues between front-line security staff and higher-ups in the central office have been identified, specifically regarding the difficulty of reaching HR due to heavy workloads.

This system aims to address these issues, focusing on improving communication and information flow within the company.
